## 📝 Abstract

<div align="justify">

CloudWatch is a real-time web-based video streaming platform that replicates the core functionalities of commercial-grade OTT services. Designed with a rich frontend and integrated backend, the platform supports user registration, authentication, profile management, multimedia content browsing, and dynamic interactions. Built for scalability and smooth user experience, CloudWatch mimics a modern streaming service interface — offering category-based exploration, trending content highlights, and detailed video previews.

Deployed live on AWS infrastructure, CloudWatch combines PHP-based backend logic with responsive frontend components to deliver a fast and visually appealing user experience across devices. The architecture is modular, allowing future integration with cloud-based media storage, authentication systems, and video delivery networks.
